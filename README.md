We investigated the phenomenon of black holes, gravitational waves, and dark matter. 
The purpose of the study is to build a model of the motion of a system of 
binary black holes in the presence of dark matter and to study the influence of 
dark matter on the dynamics of motion. 
The work's hypothesis is that dark matter surrounding a massive black hole 
can influence the dynamics of motion of a less massive black hole. 
The stages of the research include initial processing and review of literature, 
study of existing detection methods, development of our own method, writing a 
computer program, debugging the program, and obtaining and processing the 
results. 
The research methods include constructing a theoretical model of the 
motion of the double black hole system and carrying out a computer calculation. 
The relevance of the work is set by a short time interval since the beginning 
of the study of the nature of gravitational waves, as well as active research on the 
nature of dark matter, conducted to date. 
The work was done completely independently, the supervisor helped with 
the selection of literature and checking the correctness of the computer program.
